# Chopper

Chopper is a webpack boilerplate for building web applications. It is designed to be simple and lightweight, with a focus on vanilla JavaScript and minimal configuration.

## Features

- Vanilla JavaScript: Chopper does not include Babel by default, allowing you to write modern JavaScript without transpilation.
- Default CSS Loaders: Chopper comes with pre-configured CSS loaders, making it easy to import and style CSS files in your project.
- Prettier Formatting: Chopper includes Prettier, a code formatter, to ensure consistent code style across your project.

## Getting Started

To use Chopper, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/dogukan-sys/chopper.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Open the generated `dist` folder to access the built files.

## Configuration

Chopper provides a minimal configuration out of the box. However, if you need to customize the webpack configuration, you can modify the `webpack.config.js` file.
